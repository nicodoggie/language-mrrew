      <description>Introduction OK, so this language sketch is sort of jokey. I liked the idea of making a catlang, so I started to think about what that would sound like. So I decided on a few things:
 All vowels are realized with nasalization Most consonants are nasals approximants are nasalized with a very few fricatives and one or two stops The language has register and contour tones Mrrew has registers/grammatical features that use or distinguish between:  creaky voice   This does not aim to be a highly-naturalistic human language, but should at least sound as if you can imagine everyday house-cats actually speaking this when they happen to knock down that vase on your table.</description>
