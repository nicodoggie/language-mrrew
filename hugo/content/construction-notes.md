# Introduction

OK, so this language sketch is sort of jokey. I liked the idea of making a 
catlang, so I started to think about what that would sound like. So I decided
on a few things:

 - All vowels are realized with nasalization
 - Most consonants are nasals approximants are nasalized with a very few fricatives and one or two stops
 - The language has register _and_ contour tones 
 - Mrrew has registers/grammatical features that use or distinguish between:
   - creaky voice

This does not aim to be a highly-naturalistic human language, but should at least
sound as if you can imagine everyday house-cats actually speaking this when they
happen to knock down that vase on your table.

# Phonology

So, listening to my cat go about _meaow_inɡ and _raawr_ing all day, I figure, that most of the 
sounds they make usually are nasals. Even the approximants seem to be realized with nasalization!
Fricatives seems to be used for the "annoyed" or "angry" register. 

## Vowels

I don't have any sort of data, but I conclude that cats don't have rounded vowels. They do have a 
lot of unrounded vowels to compensate though, with varying frequency. Also, it is common for cats
to have N-phthongs, or strings of connected, gliding vowel sounds.

The vowel sounds also seem to be constrained to from close-mid to open, with the full range of 
frontness and backness. 

 - /a/ open front unrounded
 - /ä/ open central unrounded
 - /ɑ/ open back unrounded
 
 - /æ/ near-open front unrounded
 - /ɐ/ near-open central unrounded
 
 - /ɛ/ open-mid front unrounded
 - /ɜ/ open-mid central unrounded
 - /ʌ/ open-mid back unrounded
 
 - /e̞/ mid front unrounded 
 - /ə/ mid central unrounded
 - /ɤ̞/ mid back unrounded

 - /e/ close-mid front unrounded
 - /ɘ/ close-mid central unrounded
 - /ɤ/ close-mid back unrounded

I realize this is ALL THE VOWELS™, let's see if we either do some vowel harmony thing, or just
trim a lot of these in allophony.
