# Introduction

OK, so this language sketch is sort of jokey. I liked the idea of making a 
catlang, so I started to think about what that would sound like. So I decided
on a few things:

 - All vowels are realized with nasalization
 - Most consonants are nasals approximants are nasalized with a very few fricatives and one or two stops
 - The language has register _and_ contour tones 
 - Mrrew has registers/grammatical features that use or distinguish between:
   - creaky voice

This does not aim to be a highly-naturalistic human language, but should at least
sound as if you can imagine everyday house-cats actually speaking this when they
happen to knock down that vase on your table.

# Phonology

So, listening to my cat go about _meaow_inɡ and _raawr_ing all day, I figure, that most of the 
sounds they make usually are nasals. Even the approximants seem to be realized with nasalization!
Fricatives seems to be used for the "annoyed" or "angry" register. 

## Vowels

Ok, since my last edit here, I've reduced my vowel inventory to these nine. Still keeping to the
notion that cats don't have rounding to them, and probably not do some harmony, because I don't think
it will sound cat-like enough.

 - /i/ close front unrounded
 - /ɨ/ close central unrounded
 - /ɯ/ close back unrounded
 
 - /ɛ/ open-mid front unrounded
 - /ɜ/ open-mid central unrounded
 - /ʌ/ open-mid back unrounded
 
 - /a/ open front unrounded
 - /ä/ open central unrounded
 - /ɑ/ open back unrounded

## Syllables

Syllable shapes of Mrrew are constrained to fit a certain sound I want (which is, naturalistic cat sounds).

All syllables must have onsets, while codas are optional. There can be many such nasals realized at a time
within a complex cluster.

These consonant clusters are allowable in word-initial onsets:

 * [Nasal]<sup>+</sup>[Approximant]<sup>*</sup>
 * [Nasal]<sup>+</sup>[Approximant]<sup>+</sup>[Lateral]<sup>*</sup>
 * [Nasal]<sup>+</sup>[Trill]<sup>+</sup>
 * [Trill]<sup>+</sup>[Approximant]<sup>*</sup>
 
These consonant clusters are allowable in word-final codas:

 * [Lateral]<sup>+</sup>
 * [Approximant]<sup>+</sup>
 * ([Approximant]<sup>+</sup>[Lateral]<sup>+</sup>)<sup>*</sup>

These consonant clusters are allowable elsewhere:

 * [Approximant]<sup>+</sup>
 
These consonants have a null nucleus.
 * [Fricative]<sup>+</sup>

| :-----------------: | :------: | :------: | :----------: | :-------: | :-----: | :---: | :----: |
| Stop                |          |          |              |           |         |       | q      |

| Fricative           |          |          |              |           |         | x     |        |
| Approximant         |          |          | ɹ            | ɻ         | j       | ɰ     |        |
| Lateral Approximant |          |          |              | ɭ         | ʎ       | ʟ     |        |

Here we have all the consonants. Here we also have ALL THE NASALS™, but I am thinking of making the 
alveolar, postalveolar and retroflex into allophones too, maybe.

## Suprasegmentals

### Tone

Tone in mrrew actually encodes meaning depending on where and how it is used.

When used word-initially in verbs, tone encodes the following moods:
 - Low tone - Prohibitive 
 - Falling tone - Volitive
 - Rising tone - Imperative
 - High tone - Optative

# Verbs

I want to have the verbs basically as agglutinating here. Some suffixes:
S
ʀ- imperative
# Nouns

# Pronouns
Mrrew is prodrop. 

# Vocabulary

food

lackinɡ food (hungry)

eat

# Translations

Feed me!
ʀːːaːɰ 

I'm hungry!
ɹːeːɰ
